<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

<!--step12-->
<p>
<!--step13-->

The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,<strong> Leonhard Euler</strong> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over<em> 800 different books and 
papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.

<!--step15-->
He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
work,<cite> Introductio in analysin 
infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
<cite>Lettres &#224; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear 
non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.

One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
Notations still in use today, such as<var> e</var> and &#960;, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
of mathematics.

<h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>
<!--step19-->



<p>Euler's Equation:</p>
<!--step20-->

<p>cos<var>(x)</var> + isin <var>(x)</var> = <var>e</var> <sup>(ix)</sup></p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity:</p>
<!--step21-->

    <p><var>e</var><sup>(&#960;<var> i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>
<p>
<!--step22-->
<!--step23-->
which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#960;,<var> e</var>, and<var> i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
